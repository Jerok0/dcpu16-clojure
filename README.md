# cljDCPU

This is a clojure implementation of the CPU which will be used in
Notch's new game: [0x10C](http://0x10c.com) The exact specifications
of the processor are available
[here](http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt)

This implementation makes no attempt to compete in the "least number
of lines" competition that other implementations seem to be aiming
for. Instead the goal is to be as clear as possible.

Future plans include:

* A Debugger (maybe graphical and cli)
* An Assembler
* A Dis-assembler

## Usage

Fill the memory map with some data and use (run!)
